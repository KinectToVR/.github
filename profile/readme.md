K2VR Team is a bunch of nerds that want to give legs to everyone in VR. We don't need to listen to Meta!

Whether you're hanging out in VRChat with Kinect tracking blowing everyone's minds when they find out it's not Vive trackers.

Or supporting fringe setups with 5 tracking overrides stacked on top of each other so every little thing with an IMU that can connect to your computer is used as a tracker.

We want to encourage and enable people to push through with setups like these. And always with ease of use, quality and stability at the forefront.

We are developing an application called [Amethyst](https://github.com/KinectToVR/Amethyst-Releases). It's a fully modular system to [allow anyone to create their own device plugins](https://docs.k2vr.tech/en/dev/overview/) for body tracking. And have them work immediately in SteamVR alongside any other plugins.

A few extra projects were/are also being worked on besides Amethyst. Most of them were/are there to support the main app.
- ~~**Amethyst Installer** --- A really fancy and overengineered (like anything at K2VR isn't?) WPF swiss army knife of an installer which takes care of updates, dependencies, has basically it's own package manager, and it's own archive format! Check it out, it slaps.~~ *Please use the Microsoft Store or the MSIX appInstaller inbstead.*
- **K2VR Docs** --- Multi-lingual docs that are made to correlate directly to errors and pages in the app. The information there is also meant to be useful if you're not even using Amethyst.
